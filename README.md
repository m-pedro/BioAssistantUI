This was part of the Reasoning with o1 Lablab hackathon we did in Oct 2024. We present a general biological research agent designed to accelerate discoveries in biology, medicine, and cancer research. Our agent combines a powerful Python-based backend 
with an intuitive chatbot front end, creating a seamless interface for researchers to interact with complex computational tools using natural language. This project demonstrates 
how artificial intelligence can streamline research processes, from literature mining to data analysis and hypothesis generation. By integrating advanced natural language processing 
models and machine learning algorithms, the agent assists researchers in navigating vast scientific literature and data. The platform can process large datasets, extract pertinent 
information, and provide context-aware responses to complex queries. The Python backend leverages robust computational libraries, ensuring efficient data handling and analysis, 
while the chatbot interface UI allows users to engage conversationally, lowering the barrier to entry for those without extensive technical expertise. One key feature is advanced 
literature mining; the agent performs comprehensive searches across databases like PubMed Central[1] and arXiv[2]. Utilizing natural language processing models, it extracts key 
findings, summarizes articles, and identifies emerging trends, helping researchers stay updated with the latest developments. Our general biological research agent represents a 
significant advancement in integrating artificial intelligence into biomedical research. We are excited about the possibilities this tool presents and look forward to refining it 
further, integrating new features, and collaborating with the research community to maximize its impact.
